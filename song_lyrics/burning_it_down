You slip your finger through the tear in my t-shirt
You stirring up dirty in the back of my mind
You keep on flirting cause you know that it's working
You stuck in my head girl writing the lines
Couldngt sing this song without you if I tried
Let's light it up like it's our last night

We're just hanging around
burning it down
Sipping on some cold Jack Daniel's
Jamming to some old Alabama with you, baby
Laying right here naked in my bed
I'm just doing my thing
You love it when I sing
Say it makes you feel like an angel
We about to get a little tangled up right about now
So girl let's keep burning it down
burning it down
burning it down

Girl when you want it, you know that I'm on it
You know that I love loving up on you
Let's hit the switch and let our shadows dance
And light it up like it's our last chance

We're just hanging around
burning it down
Sipping on some cold Jack Daniel's
Jamming to some old Alabama with you, baby
Laying right here dreaming in my bed
I'm just doing my thing
You love it when I sing
Say it makes you feel like an angel
We about to get a little tangled up right about now
So girl let's keep burning it down
burning it down
burning it down
burning it down

burning it down
burning it down
burning it down

I wanna rock it all night
Baby girl, will you rock it out with me?
I wanna crawl through the dark
Just to feel your heart beat against me

I wanna rock it all night
Baby girl, will you rock it out with me?
I wanna crawl through the dark
Just to feel your heart beat against me

We're just hanging around
burning it down
Sipping on some cold Jack Daniel's
Jamming to some old Alabama with you baby
Laying right here naked in my bed
I'm just doing my thing
You love it when I sing
Say it makes you feel like an angel
We about to get a little tangled up right about now
So girl let's keep burning it down
burning it down
burning it down
burning it down

burning it down
burning it down
burning it down

I wanna rock it all night
Baby girl, will you rock it out with me?
I wanna crawl through the dark
Just to feel your heart beat against me
