Give me all that you got now
Make you want me 'cause I'm hot now
I'm gone, so faded I'm on one
Bang bang, pop off like the long gun

If you a lame, nigga you ain't making no noise
Get faded, turn up with the big boys
Live fast, die young that's my choice
Get money, get money like an invoice

We can mob all in the whip
Make the money make the grip
I be stuntin' like my clique
Getting faded 'til we trip

Man, I love to get on
I love to get 2 on
When the drink be too strong
When the tree be way too strong
Get faded, turn up, brah pour it on up
'Til I can't even think no more
Get ratchet, go dumb, then go more dumb
Then we can keep it lit, let's roll

I love to get 2 on
I love to get 2 on
I love to
I love to get 2 on
I love to get 2 on
I love to 

Yeah, we can get active
And all my bitches attractive
We go, you know who we are now
Get high, hotbox in my car now

If you a lame, nigga you ain't making no noise
Get faded, turn up with the big boys
Live fast, die young that's my choice
Get money, get money like an invoice

We can mob all in the whip
Make the money make the grip
I be stuntin' like my clique
Getting faded 'til we trip

Man, I love to get on
I love to get 2 on
When the drink be too strong
When the tree be way too strong
Get faded, turn up, brah pour it on up
'Til I can't even think no more
Get ratchet, go dumb, then go more dumb
Then we can keep it lit, let's roll

I love to get 2 on
I love to get 2 on
I love to

Uh, pull your panties down from under you
Beat that pussy up, make you wanna holla Q
Drunk in a bitch, high on that Mary Jane
Pussy in my mouth, pussy on my pinky ring
Nasty, maybe do it in the backseat
Swear this marijuana keep it cracking
Lights, camera, action, I ain't doing nothing to the cash
Money, money, money, weed, fashion
Draped up and dripped out, keep the trees passing
Girl twerk that thing up, fuck me, fuck rap
Days of our lives so clap, clap the cake
Spreading your thighs I pump, pump your brakes

Just give me the trees
And we can smoke it ya
Just give me the drink
And we can pour it ya
And my enemies they see me living now
And if you roll with me then you'll be winning now

Man, I love to get on
I love to get 2 on
When the drink be too strong
When the tree be way too strong
Get faded, turn up, brah pour it on up
'Til I can't even think no more
Get ratchet, go dumb, then go more dumb
Then we can keep it lit, let's roll
